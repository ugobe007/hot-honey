Format:
```javascript
{
  id: 1234567890,
  name: "Startup Name",
  tagline: "Tagline",
  pitch: "Pitch",
  description: "Pitch",
  marketSize: "$50B",
  unique: "Solution",
  raise: "$2M Seed",
  stage: 1,
  yesVotes: 0,
  noVotes: 0,
  hotness: 0,
  answersCount: 0,
  industries: ["ai", "saas"],
  fivePoints: ["Problem", "Solution", "Market", "Team", "Investment"],
  aiGenerated: ["problem", "solution"],
  uploadedAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Industry Tags

Valid industries (comma-separated in CSV):
- `ai` - Artificial Intelligence
- `fintech` - Financial Technology
- `saas` - Software as a Service
- `deeptech` - Deep Technology
- `robotics` - Robotics
- `healthtech` - Health Technology
- `edtech` - Education Technology
- `cleantech` - Clean Technology
- `ecommerce` - E-Commerce
- `crypto` - Cryptocurrency
- `consumer` - Consumer Products
- `enterprise` - Enterprise Software

## AI Generation Logic

When fields are missing, AI generates:

- **Problem**: "Addresses key challenges in {industry}"
- **Solution**: "Innovative {industry} solution for modern businesses"
- **Market Size**: "$1B+ market opportunity"
- **Tagline**: "Next-gen {industry} platform"
- **Pitch**: "{Name} is transforming the {industry}"

> Note: In production, this would use OpenAI API for more sophisticated generation

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] OpenAI API integration for real AI generation
- [ ] Support for .xlsx (Excel) files with XLSX library
- [ ] Inline editing in preview table
- [ ] Validation rules (required fields, format checks)
- [ ] Import from Google Sheets
- [ ] Duplicate detection
- [ ] Error logging
- [ ] Export approved startups as CSV
- [ ] Image upload for logos
- [ ] Batch edit capabilities

## Testing

Test with the included `sample-upload.csv` file:
```bash
# File location
/Users/robertchristopher/hot-money-honey/sample-upload.csv
```

Contains 5 sample startups with varying levels of completeness to test AI generation.

## Troubleshooting

**"Admin Access Required" message:**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check admin status in localStorage
- Email must be `admin@hotmoneyhoney.com` OR `isAdmin: true`

**CSV not parsing:**
- Check column names match template
- Ensure no extra commas in text fields
- Use double quotes for fields with commas
- Verify file encoding is UTF-8

**AI generation not working:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify startup has at least name + industry
- Clear localStorage and try again

**Startups not showing on vote page:**
- Currently saves to separate storage
- Need to merge with main startupData
- Future: integrate with backend API
