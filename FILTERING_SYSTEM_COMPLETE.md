## 🔧 Components Created

### 1. Filter Script (`filter-unwanted-companies.js`)
- Scans `startup_uploads` and `discovered_startups`
- Identifies unwanted companies
- Removes from database
- Marks `startup_uploads` as 'rejected' (safer than deletion)

### 2. Filter Utilities (`utils/companyFilters.js`)
- Reusable filter functions
- Checks for public companies, mature startups, closed/failed
- Keyword-based detection
- Used by scrapers and import pipeline

### 3. Scraper Integration
- **discover-startups-from-rss.js** - Filters during discovery
- **utils/saveDiscoveredStartup.js** - Filters before saving
- **auto-import-pipeline.js** - Filters before importing
