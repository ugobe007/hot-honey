# Matching Algorithm Bias Fixes

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Investor Quality Bonus is Now Conditional** ✅
**Before**: Every investor got automatic bonus points just for existing (Elite: +8, Strong: +5, Solid: +3, Emerging: +1)

**After**: Investor quality bonus only applies if there's **actual fit** (stage match OR sector match)
- Elite: +4 (was +8)
- Strong: +2 (was +5)
- Solid: +1 (was +3)
- Emerging: +0 (was +1)

**Impact**: Prevents mediocre startups from getting boosted just by matching with elite investors when there's no real fit.

---

### 2. **Reduced All Bonus Amounts** ✅
**Stage Match**: +10 → **+5** (50% reduction)
**Sector Match**: +15 max → **+8 max** (47% reduction)
- Per sector: +5 → **+3** (40% reduction)
**Investor Quality**: +8/+5/+3/+1 → **+4/+2/+1/+0** (50% reduction)
**Investor Score Bonus**: +2/+1 → **+1/+0.5** (50% reduction)
**Check Size**: +5 → **+3** (40% reduction)
**Geography**: +2 → **+1** (50% reduction)

**Maximum Possible Bonus**: +42 → **~+20** (52% reduction)

---

### 3. **Tightened Sector Matching** ✅
**Before**: Loose substring matching
```typescript
String(sec).toLowerCase().includes(String(ind).toLowerCase())
// "AI" matches "Health AI", "Fintech AI", etc.
```

**After**: Strict matching with exact matches or known synonyms only
- Exact match required, OR
- Both sectors must be in the same synonym group
- Synonym groups: AI, Fintech, Healthtech, SaaS, Ecommerce, Edtech, Proptech, Cleantech, Cybersecurity

**Impact**: Prevents false positives from loose substring matching.

---

### 4. **Lowered Default Base Score** ✅
**Before**: Unscored startups defaulted to 50 (implicitly)

**After**: Unscored or very low-scoring startups default to **35**
```typescript
if (baseScore < 30 || !baseScore || isNaN(baseScore)) {
  baseScore = 35; // Lowered from implicit 50
}
```

**Impact**: Makes it harder for unscored startups to hit the 65% threshold.

---

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before Fixes:
- **Maximum bonus**: +42 points
- **Example**: 50 (base) + 42 (bonuses) = **92/100** (from mediocre startup!)
- **Match rate**: 74% (too high)

### After Fixes:
- **Maximum bonus**: ~+20 points (with actual fit required)
- **Example**: 50 (base) + 20 (bonuses) = **70/100** (more realistic)
- **Expected match rate**: ~40-50% (more selective)

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Investor quality bonus only applies when there's real fit
2. **Stricter Matching**: Sector matching requires exact or synonym matches, not loose substrings
3. **Reduced Inflation**: All bonuses cut by 40-50%, preventing score inflation
4. **Lower Defaults**: Unscored startups start at 35 instead of 50

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Regenerate matches** to see the new distribution
2. **Monitor match rate** - should drop from 74% to ~40-50%
3. **Review match quality** - matches should be more selective and higher quality
4. **Adjust thresholds** if needed (currently MIN_MATCH_SCORE = 65)
