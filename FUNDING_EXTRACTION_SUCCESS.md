# Funding Extraction Success! 🎉

## What Happened

✅ **Successfully extracted 6 funding rounds** from RSS articles using pattern matching!

## Results

- **Lovable** - series_b ($330M)
- **Athira Pharma** - seed ($90M)  
- **Sprouty** - seed ($550K)
- **Neural Concept** - series_b ($100M)

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify the Data

Run `check-funding-rounds.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor to see:
- All funding rounds created
- Which startups have multiple rounds (for velocity calculation)
- Total funding amounts

### 2. Clean Up Duplicates

Some rounds might be duplicates (like Lovable appearing multiple times). You can:
- Review the data
- Remove duplicates if needed
- Or keep them if they're different rounds

### 3. Continue Extraction

You have **50 RSS articles** to process. Options:

**Option A: Pattern-Based (No AI, Free)**
```bash
node extract-funding-pattern-based.js
```
- Works but less accurate
- May miss some funding rounds
- May create some false positives

**Option B: AI-Based (When Quota Resets)**
```bash
node extract-funding-direct.js
```
- More accurate extraction
- Better at identifying companies
- Requires OpenAI API quota

**Option C: SQL Manual Review**
- Run `extract-funding-sql-only.sql`
- Review articles manually
- Insert funding rounds as needed

### 4. Calculate Velocity

Once you have 2+ rounds for a startup, you can:
- Calculate time between rounds
- Add velocity scoring to GOD algorithm
- Track which investors fund fast-moving startups

## Current Status

✅ `funding_rounds` table created  
✅ 6 funding rounds extracted  
✅ Pattern-based extraction working  
⏳ AI extraction waiting for quota reset  
⏳ Velocity calculation (needs 2+ rounds per startup)

## Check Your Data

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM funding_rounds;
SELECT * FROM funding_rounds ORDER BY date DESC;
```

Great progress! 🚀
