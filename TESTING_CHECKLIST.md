# Match Search Testing Checklist ✅

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check .env file has:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3002  # or your API URL
```

### 2. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/leguplabs/Desktop/hot-honey
npm run dev
# OR
node server/index.js
```

The server should start on port 3002 (or PORT from env).

### 3. Start the Frontend
```bash
# In another terminal
npm run dev
# Frontend should start on port 5173 (or Vite default)
```
