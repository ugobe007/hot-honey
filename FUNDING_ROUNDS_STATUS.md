# Funding Rounds Status 📊

## Current Situation

✅ **Table Created**: `funding_rounds` table exists  
❌ **No Funding Data**: No funding information found in existing data

## What We Found

- **231 startups** in `startup_uploads` table
- **0 startups** with funding info in `extracted_data`
- `extracted_data` column may not exist or may be named differently

## Next Steps: Collect Funding Data

Since we don't have historical funding data, we need to:

### Option 1: Extract from News Articles (Recommended)

Create a scraper to extract funding announcements from:
- RSS feeds
- News articles
- TechCrunch, TechCrunch, etc.

### Option 2: Use External APIs

- **Crunchbase API** - Most comprehensive
- **PitchBook API** - Good for later-stage
- **AngelList API** - Good for early-stage

### Option 3: Manual Entry

For high-priority startups, manually add funding rounds.

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Check table structure** - Run `check-tables-structure.sql` to see what columns exist
2. **Create funding scraper** - Extract funding announcements from news
3. **Set up API integration** - Connect to Crunchbase or similar
4. **Manual entry tool** - Create UI/admin tool to add funding rounds

## For Now

The `funding_rounds` table is ready. We just need to populate it.
