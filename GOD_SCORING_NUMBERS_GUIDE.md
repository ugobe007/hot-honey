## What It Shows

### 1. **Overall Statistics**
- Total approved startups
- Number scored by GOD
- Number pending scoring
- Scoring coverage percentage

### 2. **GOD Score Distribution**
- Average score
- Median score
- Score range (min-max)
- Distribution breakdown:
  - 🏆 Excellent (80-100)
  - ✅ Good (60-79)
  - 📊 Average (40-59)
  - ⚠️ Below Average (<40)

### 3. **Component Score Averages**

### 6. **Sample Unscored Startups**

## Expected Numbers

### Healthy System:
- **Scoring Coverage:** 80%+ of approved startups should be scored
- **Average GOD Score:** Typically 50-70 (depends on data quality)
- **Score Distribution:** Should have a bell curve, not all high or all low
- **Component Scores:** Should be relatively balanced across all 5 components

### Red Flags:
- ⚠️ Coverage < 50% - Scoring pipeline may not be running
- ⚠️ Average score < 30 - Data quality issues or scoring algorithm problems
- ⚠️ All scores in one range - Algorithm may not be differentiating properly
- ⚠️ Many unscored startups older than 7 days - Scoring pipeline backlog

## Troubleshooting

### If Coverage is Low:
1. Check if `god-score-v2-engine.js` is running
2. Check PM2 status: `pm2 list`
3. Check automation logs: `tail -f logs/automation.log`
4. Manually trigger scoring: `node god-score-v2-engine.js`

### If Scores Seem Off:
1. Check component scores - are they all similar?
2. Review sample startups - do scores match expectations?
3. Check for data quality issues (missing fields, invalid data)
4. Review scoring algorithm weights in `god-score-v2-engine.js`
