# Funding Rounds - Final Status & Next Steps 🎯

## Current Status

✅ **Table Created**: `funding_rounds` table exists and is ready  
❌ **No Historical Data**: No funding data found in existing tables  
✅ **Infrastructure Ready**: RSS scraper exists and can extract funding

## The Situation

1. **231 startups** in `startup_uploads` table
2. **0 startups** with funding info in `extracted_data` (column may not exist)
3. **RSS scraper exists** but funding rounds aren't being saved to `funding_rounds` table

## Solution: Extract from RSS Articles

I've created a script that will:
1. Read RSS articles about funding
2. Extract funding information using AI
3. Match companies to your startups
4. Save to `funding_rounds` table

## Run This

```bash
node extract-funding-from-rss-articles.js
```

**Requirements:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- Supabase credentials (already set up)

## What It Does

1. **Finds funding articles** from `rss_articles` or `startup_news` tables
2. **Uses AI** to extract:
   - Company name
   - Funding amount
   - Round type (seed, series_a, etc.)
   - Funding date
   - Investors
3. **Matches** companies to your startups by name
4. **Saves** to `funding_rounds` table
5. **Skips duplicates** automatically

## Alternative: Manual Entry

If you prefer to add funding rounds manually, you can use this SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO funding_rounds (
  startup_id,
  round_type,
  amount,
  date,
  lead_investor,
  source
) VALUES (
  'startup-uuid-here',
  'series_a',
  5000000,
  '2024-01-15',
  'Investor Name',
  'manual'
);
```

## Going Forward

Once you have some funding rounds, you can:
1. **Calculate velocity** - Time between rounds
2. **Add to GOD scoring** - Bonus points for fast velocity
3. **Track portfolio performance** - See which investors fund fast-moving startups

## Check Progress

```sql
-- See how many funding rounds you have
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM funding_rounds;

-- See which startups have funding rounds
SELECT 
  su.name,
  COUNT(fr.id) as rounds,
  MAX(fr.date) as latest_round
FROM startup_uploads su
LEFT JOIN funding_rounds fr ON fr.startup_id = su.id
GROUP BY su.id, su.name
HAVING COUNT(fr.id) > 0
ORDER BY rounds DESC;
```

Run the extraction script to start populating funding rounds! 🚀
