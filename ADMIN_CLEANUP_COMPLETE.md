## Summary

**Before:** 15+ admin panels
**After:** 8 active admin panels + 1 legacy (redirects)

**Removed:** 5 duplicate/unused panels
**Consolidated:** All admin functionality now flows through MasterControlCenter

## Routes Updated

All admin routes now point to:
- `/admin/control` - Main control center (MasterControlCenter)
- `/admin/operations` - Redirects to `/admin/control` ✅
- `/admin/dashboard` - Redirects to `/admin/control` ✅
- `/admin/command-center` - Redirects to `/admin/control` ✅

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. Review DataIntelligence vs AdminAnalytics for potential consolidation
2. Consider deprecating AdminDashboard if not needed
3. Update any external links that might reference removed panels
