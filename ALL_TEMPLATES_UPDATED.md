- **Team**: Team composition, advisors, hiring, cofounders

## Template Priority Logic

The sequential flow guides startups through:
1. **Foundation (1-4)**: Pitch, value prop, strategy
2. **Core Metrics (5-7)**: Traction, team, PMF
3. **Strategic (8-13)**: Partnerships, advisors, competitive intel
4. **Growth (14-21)**: Talent, media, community, ecosystem

Each template builds on the previous ones, creating a comprehensive fundraising readiness program.
