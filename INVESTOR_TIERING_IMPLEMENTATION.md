# Investor Tiering Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated investor quality tiering into the matching algorithm. Elite investors now boost match scores, creating better alignment between high-quality startups and top-tier VCs.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Investor Quality Bonus System**
Added tier-based bonuses to match scoring:

- **Elite Tier**: +8 points
- **Strong Tier**: +5 points  
- **Solid Tier**: +3 points
- **Emerging Tier**: +1 point (minimal bonus)

### 2. **Investor Score Bonus**
Additional bonuses based on raw investor score (0-10 scale):

- **Score ≥ 9**: +2 points (top-tier investors)
- **Score ≥ 7**: +1 point (high-quality investors)

### 3. **Sector Match Improvement**
- Increased sector match bonus cap from **10 to 15 points**
- Better rewards for perfect sector alignment

### 4. **Score Cap Update**
- Changed maximum score from **99 to 100**
- Allows distinguishing truly exceptional matches

## Impact

### Before:
- Match Score = GOD Score + Stage Bonus (10) + Sector Bonus (max 10) + Check Size (5) + Geography (2)
- Max possible: ~127 points → capped at 99
- Investor quality not considered

### After:
- Match Score = GOD Score + Stage Bonus (10) + Sector Bonus (max 15) + Check Size (5) + Geography (2) + **Investor Quality (1-10)**
- Max possible: ~142 points → capped at 100
- **Elite investors can add up to 10 points** (8 tier + 2 score bonus)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High-Quality Startup + Elite Investor
```
Startup GOD Score: 85
Stage Match: +10
Sector Match: +15 (perfect alignment)
Investor Quality: +8 (Elite tier)
Investor Score: +2 (Score: 9.5/10)
Check Size: +5
Geography: +2

Total: 85 + 10 + 15 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 127 → Capped at 100
Result: Elite match! 🏆
```

### Scenario 2: Quality Startup + Strong Investor
```
Startup GOD Score: 75
Stage Match: +10
Sector Match: +10 (2 sectors match)
Investor Quality: +5 (Strong tier)
Investor Score: +1 (Score: 7.5/10)
Check Size: +5

Total: 75 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 106 → Capped at 100
Result: Excellent match! 💪
```

### Scenario 3: Good Startup + Emerging Investor
```
Startup GOD Score: 65
Stage Match: +10
Sector Match: +5 (1 sector match)
Investor Quality: +1 (Emerging tier)
Check Size: +5

Total: 65 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 86
Result: Good match, but investor quality limits score
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Match Quality**: Elite investors naturally rise to the top for high-quality startups
2. **Fair Scoring**: Emerging investors still get matches, but with appropriate weighting
3. **Incentivizes Quality**: Startups with high GOD scores get matched with better investors
4. **Bidirectional Quality**: Both startup AND investor quality matter now

## Database Fields Used

The algorithm reads from investor records:
- `investor_tier`: 'elite' | 'strong' | 'solid' | 'emerging'
- `investor_score`: 0-10 scale (calculated by investor scoring service)

## Next Steps

1. **Regenerate Matches**: Run match generation to apply new scoring
2. **Monitor Results**: Check if high GOD startups are getting better matches
3. **Adjust if Needed**: Fine-tune bonus amounts based on results

## Testing

To verify the changes are working:

```sql
-- Check if elite investors are getting higher match scores
SELECT 
  i.investor_tier,
  AVG(m.match_score) as avg_match_score,
  COUNT(*) as match_count
FROM startup_investor_matches m
JOIN investors i ON m.investor_id = i.id
GROUP BY i.investor_tier
ORDER BY avg_match_score DESC;
```

Expected result: Elite tier should have highest average match scores.
